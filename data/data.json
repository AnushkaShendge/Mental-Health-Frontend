      "description": "Engaging in brain exercises, such as completing a sudoku puzzle, enhances cognitive abilities, boosts memory, and promotes overall mental well-being. We all experience mental fog occasionally, but factors like stress, aging, inadequate sleep, or an unhealthy lifestyle can intensify this cognitive haze. This can have noticeable effects on memory, problem-solving skills, and overall cognitive function. Engaging in brain-sharpening exercises can boost mental agility and help your brain stay focused and resilient. Here are some well-researched exercises and games to consider. “Approaches to brain health include a well-balanced diet low in fat, low in cholesterol, and high in antioxidants,” says Robert Bender, MD, section chief of the Geriatric and Memory Center at Broadlawns Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa. Foods high in antioxidants include nuts, fruits (especially berries), veggies, chocolate, and herbs and spices, past research notes.In addition to good nutrition, regular exercise can promote vascular health to help protect brain tissue. Avoiding ruts and boredom is also critical. “The brain wants to learn new things,” says Dr. Bender, adding that some researchers believe people are more vulnerable to dementia when they pay less attention to the things around them. “When the brain is passive, it has a tendency to atrophy,” he adds. Therefore, sedentary and relatively passive activities, such as sitting in front of a TV for hours a day, can be detrimental to brain health over time. Physical exercise can also be particularly beneficial for the brain. In a small study published in September 2018 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that a single 10-minute period of low-intensity pedaling on a stationary bike was associated with increased activity in the brain’s hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for creating new memories and remembering facts and events.",

Absolutely’Seems like a normal day to day conversation between two friends. Isn’t it?Quite often than not, people who seem perfectly okay may not be alright in reality. Well, we all have days that aren’t great, when things don’t seem to work out and you don’t exactly find yourself feeling the best.With many of us however, feeling good or bad is not exactly under our control. Even in a joyful moment, you might end up feeling terrible or maybe feel nothing at all. For some people a task as plain and simple as making the bed can seem overwhelming. Needing motivation to make your bed?Too much.But it happens with a lot of people. People like you and me.When does ‘inability to make the bed’ become a problem?Like a real, serious problem.When not only making the bed but getting out of bed seems impossible and extremely challenging. And when the first question that pops in your head is “What am I going to do anyway?”Followed by “I don’t feel like doing anything at all.”",

      "description": "Mental health is an individual’s ability to cope with daily stresses and progress in a positive manner. An individual should be able to enjoy life as it is and be in a good mood. Many people still believe that mental health problems are serious psychological brain disorders. However, anyone can develop mental health problems if they are subjected to excessive stress in their daily lives. It is not a disease, but it can cause anxiety, fear, and depression in some people. Mental wellness is determined by how we respond to problems in stressful situations or events. If ignored and not treated promptly, it can progress to a serious illness.Take up our mental wellness challenge this month and overcome common barriers to ensure we prioritise mental health care. It works best if you start slowly and make consistent progress!Importance of Mental Health Awareness. Mental wellness begins with mental health awareness. Prevention is preferable to cure. It all starts with becoming aware of the problem. As a result, people should be made aware of the significance of mental health. The condition can be detected at any age, but it is most common in adults. The worst part is that half of the population is unaware that their mental health is in jeopardy, and those who are aware are unsure of what to do or who to contact in order to recover. It is critical to be aware of the symptoms and recognise the need for mental health treatment. However, symptoms of mental health issues can vary from person to person, so if you notice any signs of deteriorating mental health, it is best to seek medical advice. You should be aware that mental health care centres near you are easily accessible.",

Is it more than just attending a yoga class once a week?Most importantly, how do you decide what works in a world when the lines between work and home are becoming increasingly blurred?Why is work-life balance essential?People need variety in their time management in order to be healthy and energised over the long term, just like in our meals. We frequently make the mistake of thinking that we can work continuously or that an eight-hour workday translates into an equivalent amount of productivity.That is absolutely untrue, though. According to research, after a certain point, employees really stop producing more, but the toll on their health skyrockets.Workaholics and those who have a hard time taking care of themselves are more likely to experience burnout, weariness, and health problems associated with stress.How to achieve work-life balanceThe truth is that no single prescription will work for everyone.You might need to experiment with the time frame that feels the most pertinent to you.",

Self-care requires honoring your own needs and values, even if it doesn’t reflect other’s own self-care practices, whatever they may be. One of the most transformative moments in my ongoing self-care journey occurred when I allowed myself to be vulnerable and ask for help when I needed it most. Upon connecting with friends, family, and mental health professionals, I was met with love, understanding, and acceptance — a refreshing relief. It was through these same connections that I discovered the power that community plays in self-care. Today, as I near the end of my college experience and transition into post-graduate life, my approach to self-care is extremely open-ended. Though it’s not always Instagram-worthy, it’s real. I’ve learned to embrace what makes me feel good through life’s ups and downs. In sharing my story, I hope to shed light on whate No one should be able to tell you what self-care should or shouldn’t look like– that part is entirely up to you to determine. At the baseline, self-care is about showing ourselves the same love and kindness we would offer our peers in a time of need. So, wherever you are on your own self-care journey, know that you are not alone! You are worthy of love and self-compassion in whichever ways you choose to embrace your humanity.",

      "subCategory": "Anxiety",
      "description": "Anxiety is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses and is observed in many forms and intensities. Understanding its nature, causes and symptoms can help you gain an upper hand in your battle with anxiety.\n\nAnxiety disorders are the most commonly occurring mental illness. In fact, over 3.8 crore Indians are struggling with anxiety disorders. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines anxiety as “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure”. Though a little anxiety is a perfectly natural response to stimuli that we might deem “unsafe”, disproportionately high or persistent levels of anxiety can be highly distressing. If this feeling of anxiety reaches extreme levels for a period over six months and interferes with your day-to-day functioning or decreases the quality of your life, you are likely to be suffering from an anxiety disorder.\n\nWhat causes Anxiety?\n\nThe causes of anxiety vary from person to person and may depend on age, occupation, family history and other social and environmental factors. For instance, the greater fear of not succeeding in the highly competitive modern markets is strongly correlated with Millenials. For older generations, the lack of social support or meaningful friendships in old age can be a cause of distress and hence are more prone to alarming levels of anxiety. However, there are still many general causes of anxiety:\n\nEnvironmental Factors: Stress at work, unstable relationships, or family issues\nGenetic Factors: Individuals with a family history of anxiety disorders are more prone to developing anxiety disorders\nMedical Factors: Anxiety can manifest as a symptom of a medical condition, or as a side-effect of certain medications\nBiological Factors: Anxiety can also be caused due to a misalignment of hormones in the brain\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Anxiety?\n\nWhile anxiety is used to describe a group of anxiety disorders, referred to as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the symptoms of anxiety disorders often include the following:\n\nRestlessness, and feeling “on-the-edge”\nUncontrollable feelings of worry\nIncreased irritability\nDifficulties in concentrating\nDifficulty falling or staying asleep\nWhat are the different types of Anxiety?\n\nUnderstanding what type of anxiety disorder you are dealing with could go a long way in helping you find the right help.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD, is a chronic disorder where a person experiences excessive, long-lasting anxiety and worries without any specific trigger\n\nSymptoms for a Panic Disorder include brief or sudden attacks of intense terror and apprehension, known as panic attacks. Other consequent physical symptoms may include shaking, confusion, dizziness, nausea, and breathing difficulties that may escalate rapidly and peak within a few minutes\n\nOne might also develop a specific Phobia, which is an irrational fear towards a certain situation or object. The difference between a phobia and otheranxiety disorders is that phobias have a specific trigger. Social Anxiety Disorder or Social Phobia is rooted in the overwhelming fear of negative judgment from others or of public embarrassment. Commonly observed manifestations of Social Anxiety Disorder include stage fright, a fear of intimacy, and the fear of rejection. As a result of this, avoidance of social situations can start interfering with day-to-day activities.",
